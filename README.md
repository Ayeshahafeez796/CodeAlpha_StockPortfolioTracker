# CodeAlpha_StockPortfolioTracker
A simple Python Stock Portfolio Tracker for CodeAlpha Internship — calculates total investments based on manually defined stock prices.
This project is developed as part of the Python Programming Internship at CodeAlpha. 
The Stock Portfolio Tracker allows users to input stock names, number of shares, 
and manually defined prices per share. It calculates the total investment per stock 
and displays the grand total for the entire portfolio. The project demonstrates 
basic Python concepts including functions, loops, dictionaries, and user input, 
while providing a clean and easy-to-use console interface.
